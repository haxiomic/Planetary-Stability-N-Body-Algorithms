Notes

Current implementation of Trails is slow due to repeated uploading of vertices's to GPU every frame (despite there has been no change)

Slow down mainly caused by getUniformLocation being call too many times (instead of stored location lookups). Called by:
	flash.display3D.Context3D.setGLSLProgramConstantsFromVector4
And less so by
	flash.display3D.AGLSLContext3D.$extend.drawTriangles

This has been fixed in local version of away3d-openfl

HAXE BUGS
- Order matters for abstract type '@:from's - ie, switch dynamic and TVec3 in AVec and you'll find all TVec3s are registered as dynamics not TVec3
