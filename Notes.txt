Notes

Solar systems slowly moves because the more massive planets have yet to be added!!


Slow down mainly caused by getUniformLocation being call too many times (instead of stored location lookups). Called by:
	flash.display3D.Context3D.setGLSLProgramConstantsFromVector4
And less so by
	flash.display3D.AGLSLContext3D.$extend.drawTriangles

This has been fixed in my fork of away3d-openfl

Performance improvements can be made to trail drawing by rendering has single entity rather than separate objects to minimize information transfer to the GPU, however there is no rush

HAXE BUGS
- Order matters for abstract type '@:from's - ie, switch dynamic and TVec3 in AVec and you'll find all TVec3s are registered as dynamics not TVec3
