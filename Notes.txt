Notes

- Need data for sun's velocity about solar system's center of mass for initial conditions
- AVec3 shouldn't be creating new objects, but I can't see how to avoid this.
- Segment not yet supported! Must use planes


HAXE BUGS
- Order matters for abstract type '@:from's - ie, switch dynamic and TVec3 in AVec and you'll find all TVec3s are registered as dynamics not TVec3
