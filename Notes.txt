Currently building with:
	lime test mac --build-library=hxcpp -64

---- Notes ----
TODO
- AdaptiveTimestep velocity can probably be set from acceleration with addFn in each body part of kick, minor improvement
- Orbital params, eccentricity and whatnot
- Better constants
- VPointer should be using unsafe calls

 -- BUGS --

- Order matters for abstract type '@:from's - ie, switch dynamic and TVec3 in AVec and you'll find all TVec3s are registered as dynamics not TVec3
